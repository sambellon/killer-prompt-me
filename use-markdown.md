# create markdown files for your images pages!

If you want to get creative with markdown, refer tothis [**style guide**](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

My original plan was to have seperate text files to store the prompts, and use hashes to link to the images, but I think it will be better to include the prompt adjascent to the image in the same file.

> [!NOTE]
> For the document that contains your images, make sure it has the .md extension - this allows you to add linked images.
